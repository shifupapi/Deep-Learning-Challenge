# Deep-Learning-Challenge

### The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:


* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively


### I did 80 hiddennodes1, 30 hiddennodes2, and 1 hiddennodes3



###Optimization Test #1 I put the cutoff value of the application types to <100 and the cutoff value for the classifications to <100 for the first optimization test.
###Optimization Test #2 I put put the cutoff value of the application types to <100 and the cutoff value for the classifications to <400 for the first optimization test.
###Optimization Test #3 I put put the cutoff value of the application types to <100 and the cutoff value for the classifications to <800 for the first optimization test.
### I was not able to achieve the target model performance as I only got 72% to 73% accuracy. I was attempting to achieve and accuracy of 75%. My only conclusion is that I probably needed to clean up the data given to me more.
